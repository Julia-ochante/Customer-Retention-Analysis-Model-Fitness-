# üèãÔ∏è Customer Retention Analysis ‚Äì Model Fitness  

## Project Description  
Model Fitness gym chain is developing a data-driven customer interaction strategy.  
The project objectives were:  
- Predict the probability of churn (for the following month) for each client.  
- Create user profiles by segmenting the most representative groups and describing their main characteristics.  
- Analyze the factors with the greatest impact on churn.  
- Draw key insights and propose recommendations to improve customer retention:  
  - Identify target groups.  
  - Suggest measures to reduce churn.  
  - Highlight additional patterns related to client interaction.  

## üîç Key Findings  

### Main factors associated with churn:  
- Short-term contracts.  
- Low frequency of class attendance.  
- Little or no participation in group activities.  
- Low use of additional services.  

### Clients most likely to churn:  
- Mostly new, young customers.  
- Hold short-term contracts.  
- Attend infrequently and lack social integration (no friends brought in, no group class attendance).  

### Loyal customers:  
- Hold long-term contracts.  
- Show high frequency of attendance and active participation in group classes.  
- Many were referred by friends or have social ties within the gym.  
- Longer customer lifetime.  

## üéØ Strategic Recommendations  

### 1. Improve retention of new customers  
- Create onboarding programs with incentives for early participation in group classes.  
- Send personalized reminders or motivational messages during the first weeks of membership.  

### 2. Encourage additional service usage  
- Offer progressive discounts on complementary services (cafeteria, massages, coaching, etc.) based on attendance or membership duration.  
- Bundle additional benefits into long-term contracts to increase perceived value.  

### 3. Proactive monitoring of at-risk customers  
- Detect clients with recent declines in attendance and contact them with offers or personalized messages.  
- Automate internal alerts to intervene before cancellations occur.  

### 4. Promote social engagement and longer contracts  
- Strengthen referral programs (‚Äúbring a friend‚Äù) with clear and valuable rewards.  
- Offer exclusive benefits for members who commit to longer contracts.
